## Characters
### <img src="./assets/sprites/kaori/kaori-icon.png" alt = "Kaori Icon" width=25> Kaori
A young woman proficient with multiple types of firearms. A keen vigilante with strong moral values who always tries to do right by her loved ones while satiating her love for combat.

Kaori overwhelms her enemies through sheer force: destroying them with powerful bullets at a rapid pace, however, her own defences are lacking.

If she collects the energy pills in her level, she can shoot multiple bullets in the boss room, destroying the strongest enemies with speed and precision.

### <img src="./assets/sprites/ren/ren-icon.png" alt = "Ren Icon" width=25> Ren
A young man who's fairly disinterested in putting his life on the line to stop killer robots, but equally doesn't want to leave his girlfriend to handle them alone. He seems a little moody, but his heart's in the right place!

Ren takes things fairly slow, toasting his enemies with somewhat weak fireballs. His defences, however, are top-notch, allowing him to take many hits with ease.

If he collects the energy pills in his level, he will briefly become invincible, giving him a window to dismantle his foes' defences at no risk to himself.

## Levels
### Kaori Level
Navigate down through the mansion, taking care to avoid traps. If you can't progress, make sure to destroy every enemy in sight!

### Ren Level
Navigate up through the cold, lower levels of the mansion. Besides killer robots, there is slippery, painful ice you must melt with his magic!

### Boss Level
The final standoff: take down a giant UFO who's dispatching countless minions to try and stop you! If you've collected energy pills, this is much easier.

## Enemies
### <img src="./assets/sprites/enemies/ufo-icon.png" alt = "UFO Icon" width=25> UFO
A simple enemy which, when approached, will pursue the player horizontally. Despite all appearances, they actually can't fly!

### <img src="./assets/sprites/enemies/missile-icon.png" alt = "Missile Icon" width=25> Missile
A cruel enemy which will relentlessly pursue the player for as long as it lives... Can fly anywhere on screen!

### <img src="./assets/sprites/enemies/tank-icon.png" alt = "Tank Icon" width=25> Tank
A powerful, yet unintelligent enemy which moves horizontally from wall-to-wall while shooting at the player.

### <img src="./assets/sprites/enemies/cannon.png" alt = "Cannon Icon" width=25> Cannon
Harmless... Until it shoots out a UFO, Missile or Tank!

## Power-Ups
### <img src="./assets/sprites/energy.png" alt = "Energy Icon" width=25> Energy Pill
Collect these throughout the stage to make the final boss easier! One pill results in one second of powered-up play.
